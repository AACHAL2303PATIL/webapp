### Adding Audio Recordings üé∂üéôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to add a new audio file to the webapp's database:

1. Go to http://xho.elimu.ai/content/multimedia/audio/list

1. Press the "Add audio" button.

1. If the audio recording is a word, the title should match the transcription:

1. However, if the audio recording is longer than a single word (e.g. a storybook paragraph), the title should be something other than the transcription:

1. If you copied the audio file from somewhere, make sure to include the license used on the website where you downloaded the file, as well as a link to the website. If, however, you recorded the audio file yourself, _you_ can select which license to use. We recommend using [Creative Commons CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):

1. Then select the audio file, and press the "Add" button. If you want to provide any additional details about your contribution, you can do so in the "Comment" field:

#### Adding Audio Recording via Another Page

Note that there are two other ways you can add audio recordings: 1) via the word edit page, and 2) via the storybook paragraph edit page:

##### Via the word edit page

1. At http://xho.elimu.ai/content/word/list you can find a list of words. While editing a word, you will see a warning saying "This word has no corresponding audio." if an audio recording with a matching transcription does not already exist:

1. Then, if you press the "Add audio" link, you will be redirected to the page for uploading an audio file, and the title and the transcription of the audio will be auto-filled:

##### Via the storybook paragraph edit page

1. While editing a storybook paragrah, you'll find an "Add audio" link at the bottom:

1. If you press the "Add audio" link, you will be redirected to the page for uploading an audio file, and the title and the transcription of the audio will be auto-filled to match the content of the paragraph:

   <img width="558" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-09 at 4 56 18 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15718174/101653310-dc6aae00-3a47-11eb-9296-91856d152ce9.png">

1. If you add an audio recording this way, remember to go back to the paragraph edit page after uploading the audio file, and select the corresponding audio in the drop-down:
